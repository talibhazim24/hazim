<title> WHERE IS THE LOVE lyrics </title>

<center> Where is the love </center>
<br>
<br>
<center>What's wrong with the world, mama</center>
<center>People livin' like they ain't got no mamas</center>
<center>I think the whole world addicted to the drama</center>
<center>Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma</center>

<center>Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism</center>
<center>But we still got terrorists here livin'</center>
<center>In the USA, the big CIA</center>
<center>The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK</center>

<center>But if you only have love for your own race</center>
<center>Then you only leave space to discriminate</center>
<center>And to discriminate only generates hate</center>
<center>And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah</center>

<center>Madness is what you demonstrate</center>
<center>And that's exactly how anger works and operates</center>
<center>Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight</center>
<center>Take control of your mind and meditate</center>
<center>Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all</center>

<center>People killin', people dyin'</center>
<center>Children hurt and you hear them cryin'</center>
<center>Can you practice what you preach?</center>
<center>Or would you turn the other cheek?</center>

<center>Father, Father, Father help us</center>
<center>Send some guidance from above</center>
<center>'Cause people got me, got me questionin'</center>
<center>Where is the love (Love)</center>

<center>Where is the love (The love)</center>
<center>Where is the love (The love)</center>
<center>Where is the love, the love, the love</center>

<center>It just ain't the same, old ways have changed</center>
<center>New days are strange, is the world insane?</center>
<center>If love and peace are so strong</center>
<center>Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?</center>

<center>Nations droppin' bombs</center>
<center>Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones</center>
<center>With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young</center>
<center>So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone</center>

<center>So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong</center>
<center>In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in</center>
<center>Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends</center>
<center>Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother</center>
<center>A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover</center>

<center>The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug</center>
<center>If you never know truth then you never know love</center>
<center>Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)</center>
<center>Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)</center>
<center>Where's the love, y'all</center>
<center>People killin', people dyin'</center>
<center>Children hurt and you hear them cryin'</center>
<center>Can you practice what you preach?</center>
<center>Or would you turn the other cheek?</center>

<center>Father, Father, Father help us</center>
<center>Send some guidance from above</center>
<center>'Cause people got me, got me questionin'</center>
<center>Where is the love (Love)</center>

<center>Where is the love (The love)?</center>
<center>Where is the love (The love)?</center>
<center>Where is the love (The love)?</cen-ter>
<center>Where is the love (The love)?</center>
<center>Where is the love (The love)?</center>
<center>Where is the love (The love)?</center>
<center>Where is the love, the love, the love?</center>

<center>I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder</center>
<center>As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder</center>
<center>Most of us only care about money makin'</center>
<center>Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction</center>

<center>Wrong information always shown by the media</center>
<center>Negative images is the main criteria</center>
<center>Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria</center>
<center>Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema</center>

<center>Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity</center>
<center>Whatever happened to the fairness and equality</center>
<center>Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity</center>
<center>Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity</center>

<center>That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under</center>
<center>That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down</center>
<center>There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under</center>
<center>Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found</center>
<center>Now ask yourself</center>

<center>Where is the love?</center>
<center>Where is the love?</center>
<center>Where is the love?</center>
<center>Where is the love?</center>

<center>Father, Father, Father, help us</center>
<center>Send some guidance from above</center>
<center>'Cause people got me, got me questionin'</center>
<center>Where is the love?</center>

<center>Sing with me y'all:</center>
<center>One world, one world (We only got)</center>
<center>One world, one world (That's all we got)</center>
<center>One world, one world</center>
<center>And something's wrong with it (Yeah)</center>
<center>Something's wrong with it (Yeah)</center>
<center>Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah</center>
<center>We only got</center>
<center>(One world, one world)</center>
<center>That's all we got</center>
<center>(One world, one world)</center>
